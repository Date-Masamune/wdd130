            Hello! My name is Jacob Gishwiller, and I currently live in the state of Utah, USA. I enjoy studying
            weather, as I grew up in tornado alley in the state of Nebraska and became a storm chaser. I am currently
            studying software development through the BYU Pathways program. Iâ€™m excited to learn how to program, build
            websites, and explore the tech industry. I look forward to seeing where the future takes meâ€”whether itâ€™s
            finding a job or starting my own company.
        </p>

            Utah is a state in the Rocky Mountains. It is bordered by six states: Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,
            Colorado, and Wyoming. It is well known for its state and national parks, as well as skiing in the winter.
            Utah is great for those who enjoy the outdoors. Although it's in the Rockies, it is considered a desert due
            to its dry climate. Its capital, Salt Lake City, is home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ
            of Latter-day Saints.
